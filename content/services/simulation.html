</p><h2>Simulation</h2>
<p>Simulation can help your business make better decisions by reviewing many different scenarios quickly. This can help you answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why aren't a particular subset of customers happy?</li>
<li>Why aren't some orders delivered on time?</li> 
<li>Why is some expensive equipment sitting idle?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of the questions businesses ask themselves about their operations.
</p>
<h3>How simulation can help</h3>
<p>
Simulation is used to model processes in businesses and to obtain the result of execution without running the actual processes in the real world.
By modelling different "what if" scenarios, simulation can help businesses make the right decisions at the right time.
Each simulation results in various metrics, and metrics of different scenarios can be compared, making it easier to choose the best option for the challenge at hand.
These metrics may include financial indicators, quality and tonnage measurements, energy usage indicators, and many others.

<p>
Simulation, combined with predictive modelling and optimisation, is an extremely powerful combination that gives you the ability to predict
and optimise your business based on the forecast data.
