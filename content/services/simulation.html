title: Simulation

<p>
Simulation is used to model processes in the mining value chain and obtain the result of execution without running the actual processes in the real world. Here the high fidelity non-linear models produce exceptional results as the users can understand precisely what happens or what will happen during the execution of the processes. Each simulation results in various metrics which are especially important for the evaluation of different what-if scenarios.

By modelling these aspects as a what-if scenario, different metrics of this scenario can be compared, thus making it easier to choose the better option. These metrics may include financial indicators, quality and tonnage measurements, energy usage indicators and many others. The software keeps track of most of these parameters natively and therefore helps us to be more precise with our model as we are in the position to better understand what is really happening in these kinds of scenarios, thus confirming the superiority of the non-linear models.
