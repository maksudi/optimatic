</p><p></p><h2>Optimisation</h2><p></p>
<p>In the past few decades Australian companies have been under extreme pressures to deliver 
quality products and services at lower cost. This has been the case especially for the mining, manufacturing,
and retail sectors. With the increase in competition, higher labour prices, and challenging 
economy, it's becoming more and more important to optimise processes, planning and scheduling,
logistics, and transportation.

<p></p><h3>Take a minute to consider...</h3><p></p>
<ul>
<li>Could your organisation benefit from automatic workforce management?</li>
<li>Is your equipment being used in the most effective way?</li>
<li>Can you schedule different machines, taking maintenance into consideration, while keeping customers happy?</li>
<li>Is your supply chain locally optimised, i.e. do you make good decisions in parts of your supply chain but not the supply chain as a whole?</li>
<li>Do you need help with ingredient blending optimisation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our team has vast experience with these problems and can help you to achieve your goals.
</p>
<h3>How we approach the business of optimisation...</h3>
<p>
The team at Adaptic is passionate about optimisation. We employ the latest advances in
artificial intelligence and operations research to help companies improve their operations. 
We have experience dealing with problems of varying complexity from route planning to complex supply
chains where components interconnect and operate according to sophisticated rules and contingencies.
</p>

<p>
We start by building a model. While most optimisation solutions focus on linear models, the reality
is that real world is non-linear. Therefore the linear models can suffer from precision errors and a failure to handle complexity. We have extensive
experience in building high fidelity non-linear models and running state of the art optimisation algorithms on them.
This way our clients will always have the most precise representation of their processes.
</p>
<h3>How optimisation works...</h3>
<p>
We believe that nature is the greatest supercomputer and we try to learn how nature solves problems. In our algorithms we mimic
how ants, fish, and bees collaborate, how genetics works in the animal kingdom, the "survival of the fittest" principle, 
and how our brains solve complex problems. We're constantly "hungry" for the new state of the art research
and use it to provide our clients with the best outcomes.
</p>

<p>
The decision support systems we implement not only work statically but overtime, they also <b>learn</b> about your problem, your preferences
and your business, fine tuning themselves in an adaptive manner.
</p>

<p>
Why consider just one technique when we can run multiple algorithms simultaneously on the cluster and make them 
compete for the best solution for you, just like animals compete in nature for their survival.
</p>
<h3>Outcomes for you...</h3>
<p>
These are some of the areas we can use optimisation through data science to help with your most challenging problems: 


</p>
<ul>
	<li>Production line planning, scheduling and sequencing</li>
	<li>Planning and scheduling of equipment</li>
	<li>Workforce management and crew rostering</li>
	<li>Maintenance planning</li>
	<li>Supply chain optimisation</li>
	<li>Capital projects and portfolio optimisation</li>
</ul>
