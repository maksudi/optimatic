In the past few decades Australian companies have been under extreme pressures to deliver 
quality products and services at lower cost. It has been the case especially for mining, manufacturing
and retail industries. With the increase in competition, higher labour prices and challenging 
economy it is becoming more and more important to optimise processes, planning and scheduling,
logistics and transportation.

Does your company needs automatic workforce management? Is your equipment utilised in the most effective way?
Can you schedule different machines with taking maintenance into consideration, while the customers are still happy?
Is your supply chain locally optimised, i.e. you make good decisions in parts of your supply chain but not the supply chain as a whole?
Do you need help with blending optimisation?
Our expert team has vast experience with these problems and can help you to achieve your goals.

<p>
The team at Optimatic is passionate about optimisation. We employ the latest advances in
Artificial intelligence and Operations research to help companies improve their operations. 
We have experience dealing with problems of different complexity from route planning to supply
chains of high complexity where components interconnected and operate according to complex business rules.

We start with building a model. While most optimisation solutions focus on the linear models, the reality
is that real world is non linear, so the linear models can suffere from precision errors. We have extensive
experience of building high fidelity non-linear models and run the state of the art optimisation algorithms on them.
This way our clients will always have the most precise representation of their processes as possible.
</p>

<p>
We believe that Nature is the greatest supercomputer and we try to learn how nature solves problems. We mimic in our algorithms
how ants, fish and bees collaborate, how genetics works in the animal kingdom, the "survival of the fittest" principle, 
and how our brain solve complex problems. We constantly are "hungry" for the new state of the art research
and provide it to our customers.
</p>

<p>
The decision support systems not only work statically but overtime they learn about your problem, your preferences
and your business, and fine tune themselves in an adaptive manner.
</p>

<p>
Why consider just one technique when we can run multiple algorithms simultateousely on the cluster and make them 
compete for the best solution for you, just like animals compete in nature for the survival.

These are some of the "magic" tricks we can do to help with your most challenging problems: 


<ul>
	<li>Production line planning, scheduling and sequencing</li>
	<li>Planning and scheduling of equipment</li>
	<li>Workforce management and crew rostering</li>
	<li>Maintenance planning</li>
	<li>Supply chain optimisation</li>
	<li>Capital projects and portfolio optimisation</li>
</ul>
