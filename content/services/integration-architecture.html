<h2>Integration and Achitecture</h2>
<p>Traditionally, data warehouses are the best source for much of the operational and customer data required for forecasting, simulation, and optimisation problems. A good data warehouse can be a tremendous advantage. However, traditional data warehouses require expensive and uncertain software engineering to realise. They are also notoriously brittle because business conditions can change rapidly over time. Also, they require long lead times to reach a useful level of service, which in many cases doesn't match the speed of the market.</p>

<h3>Cluster computing benefits</h3>
<p>Agile methods and adaptive modelling techniques (such as Data Vault) are attempts at reducing the time and cost of data warehouses. We advocate their use for a tightly governed layer of your business intelligence strategy and architecture. However, cluster computing (in the cloud or private) can offer alternative architectures that avoid the challenges of engineering and lead-time while allowing business analysts useful access to your data assets right from the beginning of the project.</p>

<h3>Dynamic data warehouse</h3>

<p>Our reference model, the dynamic data warehouse, is based on the big data Lambda Architecture which emphasises simpler, more resilient, maintainable, and scalable solutions.. This empowers business analysts to explore the data, build hypotheses, and then offer lightweight engineering options for building decision-support tools which help move from insight to action in your business processes.
