Traditionally, data warehouses are the best source of much of the operational and customer data required for forecasting, simulation and optimisation problems, and a good data warehouse is a tremendous advantage. However, traditional data warehouses  require expensive and uncertain software engineering to realise and are notoriously brittle as business conditions change over time. Moreover, they require long lead times to reach a useful level of service, which does not match the speed of the market.

Agile methods and adaptive modelling techniques (such as Data Vault) are attempts at reducing the time and cost of data warehouses and we advocate their use for a tightly governed layer of your Business Intelligence strategy and architecture. However, cluster computing, in the cloud or private, can offer alternative architectures which avoid the engineering and lead-time, while allowing business analysts useful access to your data assets from near the beginning of the project.

Our reference model is the big data Lambda Architecture which emphasises simpler, resilient, maintainable and scalable solutions, which empower business analysts to explore the data, build hypotheses, and then offer lightweight engineering options for building decision support tools to move from insight out to action in your business process.
