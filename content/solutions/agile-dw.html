title: Faster management information
---

<p>After two decades the promise of the data warehouse has proven elusive. Organisations with large-scale investments in data warehouses (even if they've become dependant on the information) and organisations looking at new data warehouse initiatives or renewal programs both look in dismay at the cost and the timeframe. The good news is that packaged ERP solutions are offering more of the core Business Intelligence requirements on their platform. 
    
<p>The other good news is that cluster computing in the cloud or on-premise offers an alternative data processsing architecture which means that data warehouses can spend less on expensive and uncertain software engineering and instead apply simple tools and a lot of computer power to get answers when you think of the questions, not when the development backlog catches up. 

<p>Adaptic can design and implement a scalable, new generation data warehousing platform and transfer the skills and capability into your management reporting analysts. Our Lambda Architecture reference model can coexist with your existing data warehouse and incorporate existing tables and cubes into new reports. Over time, your analysts will appreciate access to a wider range of data sources, available at fine-grain level of detail, and accessible using powerful visualisation tools such as Tableau, Qlikview, R or Microsoft Excel.
