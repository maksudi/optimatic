</p><h2>Planning and Scheduling</h2>
<p>Every business has some component of planning and scheduling. For many businesses it's a heart of their operations.
A major challenge is that even with the few machines and a few customers the number of possible schedules can be enormous and beyond comprehension of even a very experienced team of planners.
It also takes days and sometimes weeks to recreate the schedule when you change a parameter, a business rule, or when you want to accommodate additional customer delivery. This can all add up to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

<p>
With an advanced  planning and scheduling system your business can produce dozens of optimal schedules within an hour, try different "what-if" scenarios, 
adjust business rules, and visualise your operations from all angles. Our team can help you with delivering such a system, choosing the right model for your business,
and adjusting it for different types of users (personas). Our team has vast experience with supply chain planning and scheduling. We have designed, implemented, tested and deployed
