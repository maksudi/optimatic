Every business has some component of planning and scheduling in it. For many businesses it is a heart of their operations.
The problem is that even with the few machines and a few customers the number of possible schedules can be enormous and beyond comprehension of even a very experienced team of planners.
It also takes days and sometimes weeks to recreate the schedule when you change a parameter, a business rule or want to accommodate for additional customer delivery and can cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

With an advanced  planning and scheduling system your business can produce tens of optimal schedules within an hour, try different what-if scenarios, 
adjust business rules and visualise your operations from all angles. Our team can help you with delivering such a system, choosing the right model for your business,
and adjust it for different types of users (personas). Our team has a vast experience with supply chain planning and scheduling. We have designed, implemented, tested and deployed
planning and scheduling systems for many companies around Australia and New Zealand. We worked with different industries including mining,
rail, port operations, wine industry, paper industry, agriculture and chemicals. And we can help your business as well!
