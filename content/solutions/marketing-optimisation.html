<h2>Marketing Optimisation</h2>
<p>Today's market requires your company to not just find the one best strategy, but to find a suite of strategies that will resonate with your customers at a personal level. Failure to do so means competing on price and joining the "race to the bottom", which is undesirable in a high-cost economy such as Australia's.

</p><p>Relevant customer data now includes more sources than ever before: not just orders and returns, but enquiries in person, via the web, social media, email, and voice calls. There is a technical challenge in collecting and collating that data into a usable form. Once you have it, relating your data to demographic reference data and applying machine-learning techniques to classify and optimise campaigns and interventions can create a measurable increase in customer satisfaction and lifetime profit.

</p><p>Our marketing analytics services mean that your creative teams can spend more time on developing and refining an innovative customer experience and less time and guesswork on the process of targeting the most amenable customers and forecasting and measuring the outcome of any campaign.

</p><p>Adaptic can help you design and realise the architecture for collecting diverse customer information. Through a controlled experiment we can model the likely outcome and value of campaigns and interventions whether you are making targeted offers, heading off subscription lapses, or proactively managing revenue collections.
