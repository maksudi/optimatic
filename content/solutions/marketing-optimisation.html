<p>Today's market requires your company not just to find the one best strategy, but to find a suite of strategies which will resonate with your customers at a personal level. Failure to do so means competing on price and joining the race to the bottom, which is undesirable in a high-cost economy like Australia.

<p>Relevant customer data now includes more sources than ever before: not just orders and returns, but enquiries in person, via the web, social media, email and voice calls. There is a technical challenge in collecting and collating that data into a useable form. Once you have it, relating your data to demographic reference data and applying machine-learning techniques to classify and optimise campaigns and interventions can create a measurable increase in customer satisfaction and lifetime profit.

<p>Our marketing analytics services mean that your creative teams can spend more time on developing and refining an innovative customer experience and spend less time and guesswork on the process of targeting only the most amenable customers and forecasting and measuring the outcome of any campaign.

<p>Adaptic can help you design and realise the architecture for collecting diverse customer information. Through a controlled experiment we can model the likely outcome and value of campaigns and interventions whether you are making targeted offers, heading off subscription lapses or proactively managing revenue collections.
