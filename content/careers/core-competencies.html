<p><img src="/images/careers.jpg" class="articlePhoto" alt="What we do">A lot has been written about the confluence of diverse skill-sets comprising the well-rounded data scientist. We're not looking for unicorns, but rather people who have the capability to contribute relevant skills into a blended team, making the team more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p><strong>Communication and collaboration</strong> - if you've lead project teams in an Agile environment, changed organisational structures or processes, or worked as an external consultant responsible for defining problems and building consensus around a way forward, then you've used these skills. Great communicators rely on attentive listening and clear presentation to help the wider team move forward together, and channel concerns or dissent into actionable feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Data manipulation and integration</strong> - this requires an ability to investigate and understand data relationships and use appropriate tools to make useful data-sets for analysis. Sometimes this is a one-time effort during discovery; sometimes it's part of an automated ETL process. If you're familiar with data domains, scripting languages, ETL tools or SQL, you've been doing this.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical analysis, experiment design and visualisation</strong> - if you can frame a statistical hypothesis, sample the data, and reach a conclusion with a meaningful explanation of confidence, then you've probably received formal training in statistics. But if you can do it on real world data-sets without making one of the myriad processing errors that would invalidate your conclusion, then you're a practitioner.</p>
<p><strong>Applying machine learning algorithms</strong> - machine learning uses the power of modern computing architectures and algorithms to find the solution, rather than having a human expert "design" it. For certain classes of problems the machine learning solution can examine more data and evaluate more permutations, getting a result faster. Machine learning models are prone to problems such as over-fitting, so careful design and testing is essential. If you've studied or applied machine learning then our company may be a great place to apply it and further develop your skills in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Problem domain expertise</strong> - to realise the benefits of our work, we need people who can anchor the theory of our advanced designs in the real world of processes, problems and quirky industry practice. Everyone on our team needs to immerse themselves in the reason for the solution, but there's always value in having experts with deep practical experience. If you have a background in one of our industry solutions, you may bring a significant head-start our clients would love to use.</p>
<p>If you have a grounding in one or more these skills and have a passion for the others, please take the time to see if you match one of our <a href="../roles/">open roles</a>.</p>
