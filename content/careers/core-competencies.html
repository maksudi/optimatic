<p><img src="<%= @items['/images/sampleImage/'].path %>" class="articlePhoto" alt="What we do" />Plenty has been written about the confluence of diverse skills sets comprising the well-rounded data scientist. We are not looking for unicorns, but people who have the capability to contribute relevant skills into a blended team, making the team more than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p><strong>Communication and collaboration</strong> - if you've lead project teams, changed organisation structures or processes, or worked as an external consultant responsible for defining problems and building consensus around a way forward, then you've used these skills. Great communicators rely on attentive listening and clear presentation to help the wider team move forward together, and channel concerns or dissent into actionable feedback.
<p><strong>Data manipulation and integration</strong> - this requires an ability to investigate and understand data relationships and use appropriate tools to make useful datasets for analysis. Sometimes this is a one-time effort during discovery, and sometimes this is part of an automated ETL process. If you're familiar with data domains, scripting languages, ETL tools or SQL, you've been doing this.
<p><strong>Statistical analysis, experiment design and visualisation</strong> - if you can frame a statistical hypothesis, sample the data, and reach a conclusion with a meaningful explanation of confidence, you have probably received formal training in statistics. But if you can do it on real-world data sets without making one of the myriad processing errors which would invalidate your conclusion, then you are a practitioner.
<p><strong>Applying machine learning algorithms</strong> - machine learning uses the power of modern computing architectures and algorithms to find the solution, rather than having a human expert design it. For certain classes of problems, the machine learning solution can examine more data, evaluate more permutations, getting a result faster. Machine learning models are prone to problems such as overfitting, so careful design and testing is essential. If you've studied or applied machine learning, our environment and work may be a great place to apply it and develop yourself further.
<p><strong>Problem domain expertise</strong> - to realise the benefits of our work, we need people who can anchor the theory of our advanced designs in the real world of processes, problems and quirky industry practice. Everyone on our team needs to immerse themselves in the reason for the solution, but there is always value in having experts with deep practical experience. If you have a background in one of our industry solutions, you may bring a significant headstart our clients would love to use.   

<p>If you have a grounding in one or more these skills and have a passion for the others, please take the time to see if you match one of our <a href="../roles/">open roles</a>.
