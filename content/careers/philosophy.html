<h2>Culture and identity</h2>
<p>Adaptic is a great place to do great work and we are assembling a vibrant and diverse team. We encourage <a href="http://qz.com/197060">flexible hours</a> and offer comprehensive lifestyle benefits to all staff (including health insurance and gym membership). We ensure you have time for all parts of your life and that at the end of the week, you are hungry for more.
</p>
<p>We avoid secrecy or bureacracy and concentrate on flexibility and empowerment. Our operating system (<a href="http://holacracy.org/">holacracy</a>) favours purpose-driven work and distributes authority, making us lean and adaptable. Every team member has visibility of the company financials including salaries, and remuneration is predominantly formula-driven.
</p>
<p> If you want your profession to be a satisfying and rewarding part of your life, check the kinds of <a href="../core-competencies/">core competencies</a> you will have (or be developing) while you work with us.
