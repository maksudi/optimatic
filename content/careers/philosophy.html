<h2>Culture and identity</h2>

<p>Optimatic is a great place to do great work and we are assembling a vibrant and diverse team. We work <a href="http://qz.com/197060">four days per week</a> and offer comprehensive lifestyle benefits to all staff (including health insurance and gym membership). We ensure you have time for all parts of your life and that at the end of the week, you are hungry for more.
    
<p>We avoid secrecy or bureacracy and concentrate on flexibility and empowerment. Our operating system (<a href="http://holacracy.org/">holacracy</a>) favours purpose-driven work and distributes authority, making us lean and adaptable. Every team member has visibility of the company financials including salaries, and remuneration is predominantly formula-driven.

<p> If you want your profession to be a satisfying and rewarding part of your life, check the kinds of <a href="../core-competencies/">core competencies</a> you will have (or be developing) while you work with us.

<p>We do things differently at Optimatic and proudly so. We've worked in companies which run like a unit of the armed forces, behave like families, or have you orbiting around a few key personalities. 

<p>We model ourselves on a band of musicians on the cusp of fame - each member performing their own music well, yet growing as a musician over time. We have a dedicated road-crew who love our music, but we step in to do whatever is needed to make each performance of the band's music stirring and memorable.

<p>Particular members might be responsible for specifics, like bookings, but every member of the team is integral to bringing together a great performance. Consequently, we focus on letting every member of the team become engaged and passionate about the work.

<p>To do this at Optimatic, we provide transparency for all staff through open-book financials and remuneration. With transparent salaries and bonuses set by formula, we mostly set aside doubts about equitability and reward. 

<p>We also want to create an environment which nurtures the kind of people we want to play with. People who have rich and diverse lives outside of work, who are fit and healthy, and never overtaxed to the point that work is a chore.  

<p>Finally, we do things our way. We seek out clients and projects who believe in the things we believe in. We sell work based on our professional opinions and after tuning into our clients wavelength, create something that will leave them as true fans.
