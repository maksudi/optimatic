<p>If you like the <a href="../philosophy/">way we think</a> about business and want to join our team, and assuming you have a basis and a passion for the <a href="../core-competencies/">core competencies</a> of a data scientist, drop us a line telling us which of the roles below sounds most like you. 
</p>
<p>We don't rely on resumes. We meet you, talk to you, and you show us your work. Then we invite you to shadow one of our teams to see if we work well together. When you join our team you'll be on a short probation period, but paired with a senior mentor within the company.
</p>
<h2>Open roles</h2>
<p><strong>Data specialist</strong> - this is a client-facing role where you'll take primary responsibility for securing, anonymising, and migrating data in a form ready for consumption by analytical modelling. In consultation with client technical stakeholders, you'll use scripts and ETL tools on heterogeneous environments to bring the data from every kind of source system into the data lake, and then into a usable structure. Problems of alien file formats, traversing network security zones, and compound key matching are your amusing brainteasers.
</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning specialist</strong> - a client-facing role, you'll take primary responsibility for algorithm selection, testing, and tuning of machine learning models as part of a client solution. You will provide evaluation of different approaches to the problem at hand, and through iterative proofs of concept find the best solution or, more likely, the best hybrid. You'd rather compete on Kaggle after work than watch TV.
</p>
<p><strong>Consultant</strong> - a generalist data scientist responsible for bringing together strands of the design approach and solution in concert with the joint Adaptic and client team. Having developed a deep understanding of the client's opportunity, the consultant establishes measurement of outcomes in the relevant business context, and explores and communicates options to the team, including directly applying the tools and techniques of data science to help build the proof of concept or the solution.
</p>
<p><strong>Principal consultant</strong> - an experienced consulting data scientist with responsibility for monitoring and communicating the direction and progress of a larger project to senior client and Adaptic stakeholders. This requires facilitating and maintaining a consensus about direction across the team and gathering information to make forecasts about where the project is headed. Our teams are Agile, so this does not mean grabbing and holding the wheel, but with your experience, you'll have a special insight into when to persist with the planned approach and when to pivot.
