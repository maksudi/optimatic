<p>Adaptic Solutions is an independent data science consultancy, committed to helping our clients using evidence to drive business decisions, and to improve outcomes for customers, staff and shareholders.

<h2>How we can help</h2>
<p>Adaptic can work with you to:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Create a strategy for identifying and proving data science opportunities in your organisation, in consultation with all levels of your team.
    <li><strong>Capability:</strong> Develop your data science capability by helping you select and acquire hardware and software, as well as develop the processes, organisation structures and skills you will need to realise your strategy.
    <li><strong>Data engineering:</strong> Lead or support your data engineering work to integrate your transactional and source systems into your computing cluster, and allow them to be consumed by modelling and visualisation tools.
    <li><strong>Data science:</strong> Lead or support your data science work to design learning experiments, select and train models, and evaluate their effectiveness.
</ul>

<h2>Why data science?</h2>
<p>By using advanced architectures and machine learning algorithms, more data can be utilised, not just from core transaction systems, but from peripheral systems including web-site logs, contact-centre notes and call transcripts, store monitoring and external social media streams, which together create a much richer view of your customers and stakeholders than has been possible before.
<p>More data has traditionally required much more integration work and more expensive and slow engineering. Cluster computing (either in the cloud or on-premise) and powerful end-user tools offer a new approach which can drastically reduce the time and cost of generating insight from your data. Predictive analytics and machine learning can further leverage the computing power in your cluster to create forecasts, simulation, and optimisation models which you can use to inform management and operational decisions.
<p>Once decision-making models have been trained they need to be integrated into the business process. For example, the output of a next best offer recommender model needs to be published as a highly responsive service that the CRM system in the contact centre or the public web store can call once a contacter has been identified.
