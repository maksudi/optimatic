<h3 class="post-title">Why data science?</h3>
<p>By using advanced architectures and machine learning algorithms, data can be used from both core and peripheral systems including web-site logs, contact-centre notes and call transcripts, store monitoring and external social media streams, together creating a much richer view of your customers and stakeholders than has been possible before.</p>
<p>Up until now, more data has meant more integration work as well as more expensive and slow engineering. Cluster computing (either in the cloud or on-premise) together with powerful end-user tools offer a new approach that can drastically reduce the time and cost of generating insights from your data. <a href="../services/predictive-modelling/">Find out more about how data science can help you...)</a></p>
