<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>If you're like us, you believe that finding and communicating the truth will lead to an enlightened business, which in turn will lead to an enlightened society. Correctly applying the most relevant data will lead to better decision-making with less bias and better, fairer outcomes for all stakeholders, including reward where reward is due.
</p>
<p>The power of big data and machine learning creates a responsibility for an organisation. While we know that investing in these technologies must generate significant value, we are absolutely committed to the ethical obligations of privacy, fairness, and transparency.  
</p>
<p>We apply this philosophy to the solutions we help you create, and to our work for you.
</p>

<h2>How we deliver you results</h2>
<p>As stewards, we use protocols and standards that reflect the sensitivity and potential value of your data. We treat it as confidential, protecting against accidental disclosure and protecting the rights of the individuals who may be its subject. This is true whether we are using your infrastructure or ours to achieve your data science goals.
</p>

<p>As data scientists and designers, we pay careful attention to experiment design and statistical rigour to ensure that the conclusions of our work are valid and reliable. We ensure there is measurement and reporting in the areas of your greatest challenges so as to ensure transparency, allowing you to make informed investment decisions. We recommend the best tools (usually open source) for your specific needs so as to minimise cost and maximise flexibility. 
</p>

<p>By surfacing the information inside your data assets and the processes which consume them, and making it accessible to empowered individuals, your organisation can do business better.
</p>

<h2>What we do for you</h2>
<p>We are a boutique consultancy applying modern architectures and advanced machine learning techniques to provide dramatic performance improvements in your company's marketing, sales, and/or operations. We work in partnership with your team to ensure that the best solution can be designed, proven and scaled while keeping investment costs low until the opportunity is proven to be effective.
</p>
<p>Modern architectures and cloud infrastructure can be quickly implemented, scaled down for testing, and require minimal investment during proof of concept. They can be quickly refined and scaled up when your business benefits are proven.
</p>
<p>Advanced machine learning techniques reduce the expense, complexity and delay of custom solutions by using industry-standard algorithms and statistics to find actionable insights.
